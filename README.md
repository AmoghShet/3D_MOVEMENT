# 3D Movement Test

This repository contains a set of Python scripts that implement a 3D movement test using Pygame. The project showcases various aspects of 3D graphics, movement, and basic physics.

## Files

- `movement.py`: Basic setup for a 3D wireframe grid with simple movement controls & dots.
- `movement2.py`: Replaced dots with lines.
- `movement3.py`: Added ability to jump.
- `movement4.py`: Added ability to sprint.
- `movement5.py`: Added heabobbing.
- `movement6.py`: Added different headbobs based on walk or sprint.

## Features

- **3D Wireframe Grid**: A simple 3D grid is rendered to simulate a wireframe environment.
- **Player Movement**: The player can move forward, backward, and rotate left and right.
- **Camera and Perspective**: Implements a basic camera system with perspective projection.
- **Gravity and Jumping**: Simulates gravity affecting the player and allows jumping.
- **Head Bobbing**: Adds a head bobbing effect when the player moves to simulate walking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install Pygame using pip:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, simply execute any of the Python scripts. For example:

```sh
python movement.py
```

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Control the movement of the player.
  - Up Arrow: Move forward
  - Down Arrow: Move backward
  - Left Arrow: Rotate left
  - Right Arrow: Rotate right
